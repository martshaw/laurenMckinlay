	<p class="">Pocket Square
You might think that the pocket square is an enigmatic little fashion accessory but in essence it is no more than a handkerchief made purely for show. It is no longer reserved for the upper classes or the highflying businessman, but now established for the everyman. Yes Hollywood legends such as Frank Sinatra and Clarke Gable were never without theirs, but today look to any music video or red carpet event and it will undoubtedly have its very own smattering of pocket squares. </p><p class=""><b>Times may have changed but the pocket square remains firmly at the forefront of style and class.&nbsp;</b></p><p class="">It is thought that King Richard II of England was the man behind the invention of the handkerchief in the 14th century - although this was a piece of cloth used to wipe his nose. Through time this cloth was adapted to function chiefly for fashion; a true symbol of gentility and elegance. Men had to adapt – now there was a handkerchief that lived in your trouser pocket and was used for hygiene, as well as the far more refined pocket square whose pride of place was the jacket pocket for all to see. By the early 1900s a gentleman would not be seen without a pocket square in his jacket’s left breast pocket. Silk, linen, and cotton were always the favorable materials.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><b>&nbsp;So why wear a pocket square today?</b>&nbsp;</p><p class="">&nbsp;The nature of a pocket square is to create an element of personal style and personality to your outfit. It can distinguish you from all other men in a plain suit or jacket. For a small price the pocket square can add a touch of life and colour to an otherwise nondescript suit. With the right collection in your arsenal the hues of any shirt or tie can be echoed or hinted at. There is no such thing as a casual or formal pocket square; it will always take on the character of the attire you have paired it with. Therefore a cotton polka dot style will work just as well with your business suit as it will with a casual weekend blazer.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><b>Folding and styling.</b></p><p class="">There are countless ways to fold a pocket square; the traditional ‘one point’ or ‘flat’ folds are of course simple and effective but you can also get a little more creative. An attractive ‘four point crown’ or ‘double point roll’ will inevitably take more fiddling with until perfect, but then no one said style came without a little work. Experiment with different approaches and find what expresses you best.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><b>Care and cleaning.</b></p><p class="">A little care and attention when handling your pocket squares could make all the difference in the lifespan of the fabric. Cotton and linen can be washed at home in the sink, but if in doubt take them to a good dry cleaners. Dry-cleaning will also keep the colours of the fabric from fading. Silk can be washed with a gentle shampoo or soap as it is similar in essence to human hair. Choose a PH neutral brand and use lukewarm water. Always hang your pocket square up when drying, never ever wring it out. When ironing use a low silk setting and place a (clean) thin tea towel on top as a cautionary measure to stop a high shine developing.&nbsp;<br></p>	</div>
