	<p class="">Pocket Square
You might think that the pocket square is an enigmatic little fashion accessory but in essence it is no more than a handkerchief made purely for show. It is no longer reserved for the upper classes or the highflying businessman, but now established for the everyman. Yes Hollywood legends such as Frank Sinatra and Clarke Gable were never without theirs, but today look to any music video or red carpet event and it will undoubtedly have its very own smattering of pocket squares. </p><p class=""><b>Times may have changed but the pocket square remains firmly at the forefront of style and class.&nbsp;</b></p><p class="">It is thought that King Richard II of England was the man behind the invention of the handkerchief in the 14th century - although this was a piece of cloth used to wipe his nose. Through time this cloth was adapted to function chiefly for fashion; a true symbol of gentility and elegance. Men had to adapt – now there was a handkerchief that lived in your trouser pocket and was used for hygiene, as well as the far more refined pocket square whose pride of place was the jacket pocket for all to see. By the early 1900s a gentleman would not be seen without a pocket square in his jacket’s left breast pocket. Silk, linen, and cotton were always the favorable materials.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><b>&nbsp;So why wear a pocket square today?</b>&nbsp;</p><p class="">&nbsp;The nature of a pocket square is to create an element of personal style and personality to your outfit. It can distinguish you from all other men in a plain suit or jacket. For a small price the pocket square can add a touch of life and colour to an otherwise nondescript suit. With the right collection in your arsenal the hues of any shirt or tie can be echoed or hinted at. There is no such thing as a casual or formal pocket square; it will always take on the character of the attire you have paired it with. Therefore a cotton polka dot style will work just as well with your business suit as it will with a casual weekend blazer.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><b>Folding and styling.</b></p><p class="">There are countless ways to fold a pocket square; the traditional ‘one point’ or ‘flat’ folds are of course simple and effective but you can also get a little more creative. An attractive ‘four point crown’ or ‘double point roll’ will inevitably take more fiddling with until perfect, but then no one said style came without a little work. Experiment with different approaches and find what expresses you best.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><b>Care and cleaning.</b></p><p class="">A little care and attention when handling your pocket squares could make all the difference in the lifespan of the fabric. Cotton and linen can be washed at home in the sink, but if in doubt take them to a good dry cleaners. Dry-cleaning will also keep the colours of the fabric from fading. Silk can be washed with a gentle shampoo or soap as it is similar in essence to human hair. Choose a PH neutral brand and use lukewarm water. Always hang your pocket square up when drying, never ever wring it out. When ironing use a low silk setting and place a (clean) thin tea towel on top as a cautionary measure to stop a high shine developing.&nbsp;<br></p>	</div>

	<h2>Calling all students! </h2><h4>Tips and Hints on using Wunderlist to get the job done. </h4><p class="">After a relaxing, and altogether overindulgent, Easter Break it’s back to the real world
for most of us (sad face). However, there is light at the end of the tunnel with summer
tantalizingly close and therefore, the end of the academic year is in sight. That’s why
today 6Wunderkinder has hardworking students on our minds.&nbsp;</p><p class="">It may have been a while since some of us attended university – the year Two
Thousand and… *cough-splutter* - but we remember the essays, the deadlines, and
the mountainous stress at times. If this is sounding familiar then let’s take a look at
why and how Wunderlist2 can help you out.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><b>Keep Focused&nbsp;</b></p><p class="">It is really easy to get distracted from your studies and well, ultimately the big picture.
Using Wunderlist2 to remind yourself what your working towards can help you stay
grounded. Setting up Reminders, Recurring tasks, and Subtasks can give you that
little nudge when you really need it. For example ‘Okay, I know I’ve got an essay due
in a few weeks, but my schedule is jam-packed; university, job, a gig, a birthday. This
is NOT going to happen.’ Here might be a good opportunity to create a recurring
reminder, to help you set aside time for that essay. It could alert you every evening,
every other day, or every week, the ace thing here is that you decide.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><b>Break it Down!</b>&nbsp;</p><p class="">So you are in the middle of your academic year and you have found yourself juggling
way more balls than you can handle. Try writing everything down. Creating a list will
help you focus your attention on the most important tasks at hand. It’s amazing how
much better you’ll feel. Our ‘Smart Lists’ feature can also help you categorize
everything into succinct subjects. Filtering your list by your modules might help you
think clearer.
Say you are a student of Architecture –&nbsp;</p><p class="">• History/Theory&nbsp;</p><p class="">• Contruction studies&nbsp;</p><p class="">• Environmental studies etc.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Plus, whenever a module is empty of tasks it will just slip away into the background
until you next need it, letting you focus on work at hand. (Really we should rename
this feature ‘Stealthy Smart Lists’.)&nbsp;</p><p class=""><b>Reflect&nbsp;</b></p><p class="">Sometimes a workload can seem endless; we’ve all been there. But you have been
using Wunderlist2 for a while now, and you’ve definitely completed a ton of to-do’s
right? Well we’ve kept hold of things, which means you can take a look over exactly
how much you have achieved. The items marked off can be seen under ‘Recently
Completed’. Just check that list out! Reminding yourself you’ve done it all before can
help you believe you can do it again.
In the end we all take to organization differently, some of us are naturals, some of us
not so much!&nbsp;</p><p class="">But the underlying message to this wordy post, is that we’ve created a
pretty sharp tool and it’s here to help however you choose to use it, if you do choose
to use it. Which would be great.<br></p>

And although I hold him dear, he has been spending more and more time in my private workshop
than on the streets. </p><p class="">Most recently after being loaned out to someone (who for the purposes of this story I will refer to as ‘the breaker’) Brompty suffered a mishap.&nbsp;To put things into
context I should mention that not long before said accident, Brompty had undergone drastic pedal surgery. The amputation was long and gnarly but soon he was on the road to
recovery. One morning ‘the breaker’ suggested he ride Brompty to work. Hesitantly, slightly wavering about his state of fragility, I finally agreed. Little did I know that that
morning would be the last time I’d see Brompty.&nbsp;</p><p class="">After a Derailleur downfall en route,
he could go no further and was thereupon placed into sudden retirement. A bleak stable awaited him under the dusty desk of ‘the breaker’.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Not so long ago a new Derailleur was matched to Brompty's needs and hope was
momentarily restored. However that was more than a month ago now and still ‘the
breaker’ has him captive. I am currently in the planning phase of a rescue
mission that will see Bromtpy and I reunited. But the time is not quite right and for the
moment we must lie in wait. But soon we will once again ride off into the sunset, soon...&nbsp;</p><p class="">Lauren McKinlay</p>

	</figure><h3>Why I am looking forward to <i>Lincoln</i>. </h3><p class=""><b>'Lincoln' Directed by Steven Spielberg
General Release January 2013 </b></p><p class="">So here we are in an election year for the US and Steven Spielberg is releasing a political biopic on President Abraham Lincoln’s struggle to abolish slavery, and all in good time for Academy nominations. Yes I was very sceptical, and this could very well have been the only information I walked away knowing about the upcoming title, but it had one saving grace that left my cynical eyes and ears hankering for more. In glorious double-barrelled wording that was: Daniel Day-Lewis.&nbsp;</p><p class="">The cast is fantastic: Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln himself, Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln, and then Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tommy Lee Jones, James Spader, David Strathairn… the list goes on. And while it may be said that a famous cast alone does not a great film make, it can definitely excite movie go-ers like myself.&nbsp;</p><p class="">The film focuses on President Lincoln’s time in office nearing the end of the Civil War and the turbulence surrounding him and his campaign to abolish slavery. All in all it seems like the archetypal story from Spielberg of the underdog, the hero who in the face of adversity fights for his beliefs. This is a framework we have all seen and loved in at least a few of his previous productions. I have to admit however, to being let down by films from Spielberg in the last couple of years; <i>The adventures of Tintin, War of the Worlds, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</i> (!) and <i>Warhorse</i> a film that on paper should have had me crying like the soft hearted sap that I am, however failed even to bring a tear to my eye.&nbsp;</p><p class="">&nbsp;That being said I want to see a great film in Lincoln. The cinematography from Janusz Kaminski will be both breathtakingly serene and devastatingly dark. The story seems simple and moving if a little sentimental. And so, if I can go into the cinema with an open mind, without reading reviews from the American release in November, without hoping for History channel accuracy on events and dialogue, perhaps Lincoln will leave me believing it undoubtedly deserves one of those all important Academy Awards.&nbsp;</p><p class="">By Lauren Mckinlay &nbsp;<br></p>
